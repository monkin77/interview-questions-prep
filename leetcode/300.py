"""
Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".
