Meeting Rooms II

Given an array of meeting time interval objects consisting of start and end times [[start_1,end_1],[start_2,end_2],...] (start_i < end_i), 
find the minimum number of days required to schedule all meetings without any conflicts.

Note: (0,8),(8,10) is not considered a conflict at 8.
